# Creating a Pull Request in this Project

This document outlines the reliable process for creating a pull request from the command line in this specific project environment. Following these steps helps avoid common issues related to remote branches and command-line argument parsing.

## The Process

1.  **Complete Your Work and Commit:**
    Make sure all your changes are saved and committed to your feature branch using `git add` and `git commit`.

2.  **Ensure the Remote is Configured:**
    If you haven't already, add the remote repository URL.
    ```sh
    git remote add origin https://github.com/Frederik-N/blog.git
    ```

3.  **Push Your Branch:**
    Push your feature branch to the remote repository.
    ```sh
    git push --set-upstream origin <your-branch-name>
    ```

4.  **Fetch Remote Information (Crucial Step):**
    Before creating the pull request, it is essential to fetch the latest state from the remote repository. This ensures your local repository is aware of all remote branches, especially the `main` branch you intend to merge into. This was the key step that resolved previous failures.
    ```sh
    git fetch origin
    ```

5.  **Create the Pull Request:**
    Use the `gh pr create` command with the `--fill` flag to automatically use your last commit message for the title and body. Specify the `main` branch as the base.
    ```sh
ag gh pr create --fill --base main
    ```

By following these steps, particularly the `git fetch` command, the `gh` CLI tool can successfully compare the branches and create the pull request without errors.
