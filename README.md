This repository contains the source code for my personal blog, [FrederikSahlholdt.com](https://frederiksahlholdt.com). The blog is built with Vue 3, Vite, and Tailwind CSS, and it serves as a platform for me to share my thoughts and experiences on web development and other topics.

## Tech Stack

- **Vue 3:** The core framework for building the user interface.
- **Vite:** The build tool and development server.
- **TypeScript:** For static typing and improved developer experience.
- **Tailwind CSS:** For styling the application.
- **Vue Router:** For handling routing.
- **unplugin-vue-markdown:** A Vite plugin to load Markdown files as Vue components.
